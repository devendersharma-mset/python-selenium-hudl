# Project Enhancements & Roadmap

This document lists potential enhancements and best practices to further improve and scale this Selenium-Pytest automation framework.

---

## 1. Test Structure & Maintainability
- **Add More Page Objects:** Expand the `pages/` directory to cover all major application pages.
- **Modularize Tests:** Organize tests by feature or user story for clarity and scalability.
- **Custom Test Markers:** Use pytest markers (e.g., `@pytest.mark.smoke`, `@pytest.mark.regression`) for selective test runs.

## 2. Configuration & Secrets Management
- **Support for .env Files:** Use `python-dotenv` to load secrets/configs from a `.env` file.
- **Centralized Test Data:** Store test data in JSON/YAML files or fixtures for easy updates and parameterization.

## 3. Reporting & Debugging
- **Screenshots on Failure:** Automatically capture and attach screenshots to Allure/HTML reports when a test fails.
- **Video Recording:** Integrate with tools like Selenium Grid or Selenoid for video capture of test runs.
- **Enhanced Allure Usage:** Add Allure steps, attachments, and labels for richer, more navigable reports.

## 4. Parallel & Cross-Browser Execution
- **Selenium Grid Integration:** Run tests in parallel across multiple machines/browsers using Selenium Grid or cloud providers (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs).
- **Docker Compose for Grid:** Provide a `docker-compose.yml` to spin up a Selenium Grid locally for true parallel cross-browser testing.

## 5. CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins:** Add a CI pipeline to run tests on every push/PR, generate reports, and enforce quality gates.
- **Artifacts Upload:** Automatically upload test reports and screenshots as build artifacts.

## 6. Code Quality & Best Practices
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Use `pre-commit` to auto-run checks (formatting, security, etc.) before every commit.
- **Type Checking:** Add `mypy` for static type checking.
- **Security Scanning:** Use tools like `bandit` to scan for security issues in your Python code.

## 7. Test Coverage & Quality
- **Coverage Reports:** Integrate `pytest-cov` to measure and report code coverage.
- **Mutation Testing:** Use `mutmut` or `cosmic-ray` to ensure your tests catch real bugs.

## 8. Usability & Documentation
- **Sample Test Data:** Provide sample `credentials.json` and test data files (with dummy values).
- **API Docs Hosting:** Host your generated API docs (from pdoc3) on GitHub Pages or similar.
- **Usage Examples:** Add more usage examples in the README for common workflows.

## 9. Advanced Features
- **Retry Logic for Flaky Steps:** Add custom retry logic for specific flaky actions (e.g., element waits).
- **Custom Waits & Utilities:** Build a utilities module for common Selenium patterns (explicit waits, JS execution, etc.).
- **Mobile Testing:** Integrate Appium for mobile web/app testing if relevant.

## 10. User Experience
- **Interactive CLI:** Build a simple CLI (using `argparse` or `click`) to run tests, generate reports, and manage configs.
- **Test Tagging & Filtering:** Allow running tests by tags, user stories, or requirements.

## 11. Dockerfile and Docker-based test execution
- Dockerfile and Docker-based test execution are possible enhancements, but are not included in the current implementation.
